### City Hall Brooklyn Bridge Station

So it's like this station that just had a really LOUD noisy screeching sound. So they didn't put anything there. One dude wanted it to be a restaurant. But it was blocked by some other people. But it's actually a really nice place, and you can still see it by train!

And like you can go there today! You just take the 6 train past the last stop. It circles back around and you can see it yourself! Click this link for google maps directions: ![alt text](http:). And please watch the youtube video where an ACTUAL New Yorker explains how to get there.
