## Welcome! 

I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and humanity. There are plenty of amazing applications of programming out there, but the ones most near and dear to my heart are the ones that enchance the human experience. Accordingly, one of my major interests in language. This incorpates natural language processing/machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as more humanities centered disciplines such as learning and speaking foreign languages, reading, writing, and coming up with dope rhymes, yo. 

My personal interests include running, reading, writing, listening to music, watching television and movies, gardening, hiking, traveling, and making lists. Scroll through the rest of the website to learn more about my professional and personal interests.
